## What is life? 

It's a series of failures. 

## The purpose of our site

Like life itself, it has no purpose. 

## Stretch goals

Making a todo-list 


## What have we learned 

Mostly, we spent time making tests. This was way harder than we expected. Probably because we couldn't understand how to make tests that have no real input value. This might've been obvious to everyone else, but it was not obvious to us. 

We also learned how to hardcode variables into testing.

We got more familiar with jest and realised that you could use a lot of different things as the output thing, and that it didn't have to be "toBe".
